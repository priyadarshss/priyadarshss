# Priyadarsh S S

**Senior Software Engineer @ Emissium**, building infrastructure that turns electricity market chaos into useful data products.

Based in Lisbon 🇵🇹, working for a Swiss energy-tech startup.

## What I actually do

Right now I'm working on products that help companies track their electricity usage and carbon footprint in real time. It's energy markets meets SaaS.

**Recent work:**
- Currently working on streaming market data pipelines (Go + InfluxDB) to feed analytics for day-ahead electricity trading
- Shipped dashboard systems that let data centers and industrial facilities visualize their emissions and optimize buying strategies
- Built the API layer that ingests live data from European electricity exchanges and serve it to dashboards
- Architected the emissium platform; auth, billing (Stripe), recurring/enterprise plans, the whole thing

The interesting part isn't just the code, it's figuring out how energy markets work and translating that into something developers can actually use via APIs.

## Tech I use daily

**Backend:**  
Go, Node.js, Nginx for reverse proxies and routing

**Frontend:**  
TypeScript, React, Next.js. I care about fast UIs that don't feel janky

**Data:**  
PostgreSQL for transactional stuff, InfluxDB for time-series (energy data updates every other second)

**Infrastructure:**  
VPS (we self-host a lot using Coolify), Docker, some Vercel for quick prototypes

**Tools:**  
Linear for tasks, Cursor/VSCode for code, Postman for API debugging

## What I'm interested in

- **Energy markets & trading systems** - how electricity prices move, how order books work, what makes a good API for market data
- **SaaS architecture** - building products that scale without burning budgets or breaking under load
- **Market microstructure** - not just energy, but also how trading infrastructure works (been dabbling in prediction markets lately)
- **Systems that "just work"** - I think the best software is invisible. It solves hard problems without making you think about it.

**Fun fact:** The first website ever created is still live at [info.cern.ch](http://info.cern.ch). I like visiting it when I need perspective on how much software has evolved (or over-complicated itself).

*"Just aspiring to be a 100x dev"* - but really, I just want to build things that solve real problems without being annoying.
